                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>Up until the end of the 4th quarter of 2021, I worked as a Quality Assurance Lead in the Patient Services Department at a company called Tilray. Working in a call centre is an excellent place to hone one’s communication skills, and this was my primary focus for the last 3 years. But I eventually reached a point where I felt that if I wanted to continue to grow, I would need a new challenge. I also reasoned that while communication skills are invaluable, my skill set was missing something.</p>
                    <p>While at Tilray I took it upon myself to gather data on the quality of our department’s work and to represent that data visually through Microsoft Excel. The time I spent building these data visualizations was one of the most satisfying work experiences I’ve ever had. The time flew by and I often found myself having worked past the end of my shift. This was when I started to think about programming.</p>
                    <p>In September of 2021 I took a leave of absence from my role at Tilray and began the Software Engineering Immersive coding bootcamp through General Assembly. I graduated in December. Combined with my experience in effective communication, I want to build applications to help businesses promote and sell their products and services.</p>
